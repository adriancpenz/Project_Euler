Problem Statement:

"If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000."

The basic algorithm iterates from 1 to 1000 and examines, for every number, whether it is divisible by 3 or 5. If this is the case, the number is added to a total.
The runtime of the basic algorithm is of order 0.01 sec.

The optimized algorithm uses the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the general formula for the sum of linear sequences to calculate the same value without any iteration.
The runtime of the optimized algorithm is of the order of 10^-5 sec. 

I would give this problem a difficulty rating of 1/10. All the required mathematical concepts were relatively basic and the code-implementation also did not require any extensive coding knowledge.
